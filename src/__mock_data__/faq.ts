        question: 'What is Nebula?',
        answer : `Nebula is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity market protocol that allows users to participate as either suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers contribute liquidity to the market and earn passive income, while borrowers can obtain loans with 105% overcollateralization.`
    },
    {
        question: 'Why Aave?',
        answer : `Nebula Lending offers audited and secured services, ensuring a safe and reliable protocol. Its open-source nature allows anyone to interact via a user interface, API, or directly with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Key advantages include: Cross-Chain Compatibility: Nebula integrates with EVM-compatible chains, enabling cross-chain deposits and loans, allowing users to leverage assets across multiple blockchain networks.`
    },
    {
        question: 'What is the cost of interacting with Nebula Lending?',
        answer : `Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for Nibiru Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity.`
    },
    {
        question: 'Wherae are my supplied funds stored?',
        answer : `Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, formally verified and audited by third party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool on-demand or export a tokenised (sTokens) version of your lender position. sTokens can be moved and traded as any other cryptographic asset on Nibiru Chain.`
    },
    {
        question: 'Is there any risk?',
        answer: 'No platform can be considered entirely risk free. The risks related to the Nebula platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). Every possible step has been taken to minimise the risk as much as possible-- the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited. Additionally, there is an ongoing bug bounty campaign live and running.'
    },
    {
        question : 'Why would I borrow instead of selling my assets?',
        answer: 'Selling your assets means closing your position on that particular asset. Hence, if you are long on the asset, you would not be entitled to the potential upside value gain. By borrowing you are able to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling your assets. Users are mainly borrowing for unexpected expenses, leveraging their holdings or for new investment opportunities.'
    },

    {
        
    question: 'How do I borrow?',
    answer: 'Before borrowing you need to supply any asset to be used as collateral (check out the Supplying & Earning FAQ section for more info). After this, simply head to the Borrow section and click on “Borrow” for the asset you want to borrow. Set the amount you need based on your available supplies that would be used as a collateral for the loan. Select either stable or variable rate and confirm your transaction. You can always change your rate afterwards as many times as you want.'
    },

    {
        question: 'What is the difference between stable and variable rate?',
        answer: 'Stable rates act as a fixed rate in the short-term, but can be re-balanced in the long-term in response to changes in market conditions. The variable rate is the rate based on the offer and demand in Nebula. The stable rate, as its name indicates, will remain pretty stable and it is the best option to plan how much interest you will have to pay. The variable rate will change over time and could be the optimal rate depending on market conditions. You can switch between the stable and variable rate at any time through your dashboard.'
